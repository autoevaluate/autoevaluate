Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the development
 of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to automatically learn
  from and improve upon tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. In other words, 
  machine learning is the process of training a machine to identify patterns and relationships 
  within data, and then using this information
 to make predictions or take actions based on new data.
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning,
 unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a 
 machine on labeled data to make predictions or classifications based on new input. 
 Unsupervised learning involves training a machine on unlabeled data to find hidden 
 patterns or structures in the data. Reinforcement learning involves training a machine 
 to make decisions based on trial and error and receiving feedback in the form of rewards 
 or punishments.
Machine learning is used in a wide variety of applications, including image and speech 
recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and 
predictive analytics, among others.
