Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. 
Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions,
and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, 
ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase. 
They will be required to help identify the most relevant business questions 
 unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. 
 These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
 This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation,
 and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. 
 Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. 
 Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.
